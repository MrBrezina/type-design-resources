## Learning type design

### Beginners guides to type design

- [Design with FontForge](http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/index.html) (this is a fantastic introduction to type design, regardless of what software you use)
- [Getting started with type design](https://jonathanhoefler.com/articles/getting-started-with-typeface-design) by Jonathan Hoefler

### Workshops

Tip: follow your favourite type [conferences](#conferences) – some of them present workshops and other events throughout the year.
