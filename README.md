## Learning type design

### Beginners guides to type design

- [Design with FontForge](http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/index.html) (this is a fantastic introduction to type design, regardless of what software you use)
- [Glyphs Tutorials](https://glyphsapp.com/learn) (most tutorials here would be useful to non-Glyphs users too!)

## Software

Worth noting that discounted student licenses are available with most of these applications.

- [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/)
	- €300

	- Mac-only :(
- [FontLab](https://www.fontlab.com/)
	- $459 USD
	- The gold standard for type design software, and the longest history – first released in 1992.
